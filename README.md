# README

* **Task:** Added a real time chat feature to the project's comment section so the users can discuss their plans for the project without the need of e-mails or Slack.

* **FYI:** The feature is using the new Ruby on Rails 8 solid cable magic because it is easier to setup, faster to develop and cheaper to maintain.

* Demo available at https://homey-task-qxdu.onrender.com

## Running the project locally
